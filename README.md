# NEST (Network Engineers Systems Toolbox)

Welcome to NEST, the Network Engineers Systems Toolbox. NEST is envisioned not just as a utility but as a beacon, guiding network engineers into the world of Python programming. It's crafted to demonstrate the immense power and flexibility that comes from integrating Python into the network engineering workflow.

## Introduction

In today's evolving technological landscape, the lines between traditional networking roles and software development are blurring. Network engineers are often expected to be adept at automation, scripting, and even developing small applications. Enter NEST, a toolbox that aims to showcase the potential of Python in the hands of network engineers.

NEST serves a dual purpose:

1. **Utility**: At its core, NEST is a utility software that allows users to quickly launch various networking tools and applications categorized under different groups. Whether it's an IP calculator or a TFTP server, NEST has it all organized neatly.

2. **Educational**: More importantly, NEST is a teaching tool. By diving into its code and structure, network engineers can get a firsthand look at how Python can be used to develop practical networking applications. The structure is plugin-based, which means as you progress in your Python journey, you can develop and integrate your own tools into NEST.

## Potential & Future Enhancements

NEST is more than just the sum of its plugins. It's a canvas, waiting for its users to paint it with their innovations. Given the modular design, network engineers can:

- Introduce new plugins/tools catering to specific networking tasks.
- Enhance existing plugins to cater to advanced use-cases or better UI/UX.
- Integrate NEST with other platforms or third-party applications.
- Collaborate and share plugins within the community, turning NEST into a collective repository of networking tools.

## Conclusion

Embrace NEST not just as a toolbox, but as an inspiration. It's an example of what's achievable when the worlds of networking and programming converge. Dive in, explore, expand, and most importantly, never stop learning!
